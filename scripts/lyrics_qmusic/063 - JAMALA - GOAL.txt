JAMALA - GOAL
(Final Draw Euro 2012) lyrics
WE ALL MADE THIS HAPPY CHOICE
WE'RE ALL SINGING IN ONE VOICE
WE ALL HAVE A COMMON GOAL
WE ALL MAKE OUR FLOWERS GROW
IF NOT YOU THEN NO ONE
COME ON, NOW! I AM YOUR FAN
COME ON, NOW! YOUR EYES SHINE
COME ON, NOW! WE CROSS THE LINE!
GOING FURTHER, MAKING BETTER
NOTHING WILL STAND IN THE WAY
AND TOGETHER GETTING HIGHER
BLOSSOM OUT NOW HEY! HEY!
NEVER GIVE IN - NEVER GIVE IN
NEVER GIVE IN - HERE TO WIN
NEVER GIVE IN... NEVER GIVE IN
IF NOT YOU THEN NO ONE
COME ON, NOW! I AM YOUR FUN
COME ON NOW! YOUR EYES SHINE
COME ON, NOW! WE CROSS THE LINE!
DON'T FORGET YOUR HEART IS BRAVE
SO STAND UP AND START THE WAVE
LET'S GO OUT INTO THE FIELDS
COME WITH US TO MAKE IT REAL
IF NOT YOU THEN NO ONE
COME ON, NOW! I AM YOUR FUN
COME ON NOW! YOUR EYES SHINE
COME ON, NOW! WE CROSS THE LINE!
GOING FURTHER, MAKING BETTER
NOTHING WILL STAND IN THE WAY
AND TOGETHER GETTING HIGHER
BLOSSOM OUT NOW HEY! HEY!
NEVER GIVE IN - NEVER GIVE IN
NEVER GIVE IN - ZWYCIĘŻAJ!
NEVER GIVE IN... NEVER GIVE IN
NEVER GIVE IN - NEVER GIVE IN
NEVER GIVE IN - ВСЕ ДОЛАЙ!
NEVER GIVE IN... NEVER GIVE IN
IF NOT YOU THEN NO ONE
COME ON, NOW! I AM YOUR FUN
COME ON NOW! YOUR EYES SHINE
COME ON, NOW! WE CROSS THE LINE!
EVERYBODY KNOWS
ZERO-HOUR IS NOW!
IN UNITED BURST
WE WILL GET TO THE STARS!
KAŻDY ZNA
CHWILA JUŻ NADESZŁA
РАЗОМ ДО ЗIРОК!
Є В НАС ДОЛЯ ОДНА!
